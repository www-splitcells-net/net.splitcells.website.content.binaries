# Help for Tabulator Tables

# Sorting by Columns

The user can sort tables by a column by clicking on the respective column's header at the top.
An up or down arrow, that is represented by a triangle, indicates the order.
The sort is active for that column, when the rendered triangle is black and not greyed out. 

One can sort a table by multiple columns,
by pressing CTRL or SHIFT during the click on the column's header.
CTRL and SHIFT causes the table to not undo the previously selected columns for sorting and
instead, adds the clicked on column's header to the overhaul sort.
The coloring of the header's triangle indicates if the column is used for sorting,
just like in the case when one column sorts the table.
